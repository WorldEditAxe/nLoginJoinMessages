# nLogin Join Messages
A simple plugin for nLogin v10+ that sends join messages post-login.
## Troubleshooting
Does the plugin not work? Try these diagnostic steps.
* Make sure that `join.remove-join-message` is set to `false` in nLogin's config,
* make sure that you are running nLogin v10 or up, and
* make sure this plugin **is installed on your upstream server(s)** such as Bukkit, Spigot, or Paper.
    * We do not support Vanilla, Forge, Fabric, or Sponge server platforms. Bukkit servers *may* work, but the plugin is not compiled for it, and no support be given to those using it.

If the above diagnostic steps do not work, open a new issue. Provide:
* what the issue is,
* (optional) an image/video of the issue, and
* (optional) how to reproduce the issue.

*You are not necessarily required to provide the last two steps, but please provide them if you can. They are extremely helpful when it comes to bug patching!*
